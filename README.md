This was a Tower Defence Game that I started in September 2019 and finished in March 2020.  It was built using C# and the Unity3D engine (Using 2D assets).  Although the game
itself isnt too great it utilizes a lot of techniques with the AI enemey ensuring that they can always go in the right direction and that the user's weaponary will always
shoot the one that is closest.  The project involved the use of photoshop to create my sprites and apply unique animations to them.
